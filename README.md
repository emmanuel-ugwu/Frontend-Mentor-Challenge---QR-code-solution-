## QR Code Component

This is a simple front-end challenge from Frontend Mentor. The goal of the challenge was to build a QR code component and match it as closely as possible to the provided design.

## Built With

HTML

CSS


## What I Learned

While building this project, I practiced structuring semantic HTML and writing clean, reusable CSS. I also improved my understanding of layout techniques like Flexbox, margin and padding control, and using color palettes from a design spec.

The component includes:

A QR code image

A heading and a short paragraph

A centered card layout with padding, border-radius, and shadow effects
